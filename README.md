Project Title:

Aptos Learn - Where Learned Skills Auto-Convert to Aptos Earnings & Resume Credentials
Selected Domain:

Web Development
Problem Statement

In today's rapidly evolving digital era, continuous learning has become a necessity, yet motivation to learn often diminishes due to lack of tangible incentives and engagement. Additionally, blockchain technologies remain underutilized in educational platforms. This project bridges these gaps by creating a platform that rewards users with Aptos tokens for completing educational tasks, motivating them to gain new skills while exploring decentralized systems.
Problem Description

The Learn-to-Earn platform is an innovative educational system that gamifies learning by integrating blockchain technology. Users are rewarded with Aptos tokens for successfully completing tasks, quizzes, and courses. By combining transparent, decentralized reward systems with educational engagement, the platform addresses two major challenges: declining learner motivation and blockchain adoption barriers. Learners can track their progress, earn certificates, and showcase their achievements on a blockchain-verified resume. This solution empowers users, incentivizes knowledge acquisition, and drives skill development while familiarizing them with emerging Web3 technologies.
