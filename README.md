# Aptos Learn 🚀  
*Where Learned Skills Auto-Convert to Aptos Earnings & Resume Credentials*

## 🧩 Overview

**Aptos Learn** is an innovative **Learn-to-Earn** Web3 platform that transforms learning into a rewarding experience. By integrating **blockchain technology** and gamification, it incentivizes users to complete educational tasks and grow their skills. Users earn **Aptos tokens**, receive **NFT-based certificates**, and build a **blockchain-verified resume**, empowering them in both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
